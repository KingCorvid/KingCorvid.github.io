    <p> The Raven is a literary masterpiece written by Edgar Allen Poe in 1845 and has had an incredible impact on the world of literature to this day. Quite possibly his most influential work The Raven truly stands the test of time. Telling the story of a man haunted by a speaking Raven that can say only the word "Nevermore!" this short story provides an impressively chilling experience without ever delving into violence or body horror. </p>

    <p> Yet another horror classic, At the Mountains of Madness is probably Lovecraft's most prominent work; it helped to define his style and to pioneer the genre of Cosmic Horror. While the work can be difficult to parse at times due to the outdated language it is absolutely worth it for the moments of absolutely stunning imagery, and the incredibl unique plot. </p>

    <p> This one differs from our previous two entries in two very important ways. Firstly it isn't a literary classic as the previous two were, and secondly its not even literature! The Dentist by Bill Gray is an audio play with all the extra immersive benefits that come with it. Incredible sound design great writing and a truly tense atmosphere it's a great experience all around. </p>
